# The lcData6m.csv file contains data on 3 year loans issues in the first 6 months of 2015, which we will use for this analyses

#How does loan status vary by loan grade

#or, using table

#   Do you have loans with status other than "Fully Paid" or "Charged Off"?  
#    If so, you should filter these out. For example, if there are some loans with status of "current", 
#       you can filter these out by lcdf <- lcdf %>%  filter(loan_status !="Current")


#How does number of loans, loan amount, interest rate vary by grade

Next we will build some  models
```{r}
library(rpart)

#It can be useful to convert the target variable, loan_status to  a factor variable

#split the data into trn, tst subsets
nr<-nrow(lcdf)
trnIndex<- sample(1:nr, size = round(0.5*nr), replace=FALSE)
lcdfTrn <- lcdf[trnIndex, ]
lcdfTst <- lcdf[-trnIndex, ]


lcDT1 <- rpart(loan_status ~., data=lcdfTrn, method="class", parms = list(split = "information"), control = rpart.control(minsplit = 30))

lcDT1 <- rpart(loan_status ~., data=lcdfTrn, method="class", parms = list(split = "information"), control = rpart.control(cp=0.0001, minsplit = 50))

#Do we want to prune the tree -- check for performance with dfferent cp levels
printcp(lcDT1)
lcDT1p<- prune.rpart(lcDT1, cp=0.0003)

#......

```


Performance evaluation
```{r}
#Evaluate performance
predTrn=predict(lcDT1,lcdfTrn, type='class')
table(pred = predTrn, true=lcdfTrn$loan_status)
mean(predTrn == lcdfTrn$loan_status)

#With a different classsification threshold
CTHRESH=0.3

predTrnCT = ifelse(predProbTrn[, 'Charged Off'] > CTHRESH, 'Charged Off', 'Fully Paid')
table(predTrnCT , true=lcdfTrn$loan_status)
# Or, to set the predTrnCT values as factors, and then get the confusion matrix
table(predictions=factor(predTrnCT, levels=c("Fully Paid", "Charged Off")), actuals=lcdfTrn$loan_status)


#Or you can use the confusionMatrix fuction from the caret package
library(caret)
confusionMatrix(predTrn, lcdfTrn$loan_status)
    #if you get an error saying that the 'e1071' package is required, 
    # you should install and load that too
#Notice that the output says 
#   'Positive' class: Fully Paid
#So,the confusionMatrix based performance measures are based 
#  on the "Fully Paid" class as the class of interest.
# If you want to get performance measure for "Charged Off", use 
#    the positive- paremeter
confusionMatrix(predTrn, lcdfTrn$loan_status, positive="Charged Off")


#ROC plot
library(ROCR)

score=predict(lcDT1,lcdfTst, type="prob")[,"Charged Off"]
pred=prediction(score, lcdfTst$loan_status, label.ordering = c("Fully Paid", "Charged Off"))
    #label.ordering here specifies the 'negative', 'positive' class labels   

#ROC curve
aucPerf <-performance(pred, "tpr", "fpr")
plot(aucPerf)
abline(a=0, b= 1)

#AUC value
aucPerf=performance(pred, "auc")
aucPerf@y.values


#Lift curve
liftPerf <-performance(pred, "lift", "rpp")
plot(liftPerf)


```


Performance with profit.loss
```{r}
#Incorporating profits & costs

prPerf <- data.frame(scoreTst)
prPerf <- cbind(prPerf, status=lcdfTst$loan_status)
prPerf <- prPerf[order(-scoreTst) ,]  #sort in desc order of  prob(fully_paid)
prPerf$profit <- ifelse(prPerf$status == 'Fully Paid', PROFITVAL, COSTVAL)
prPerf$cumProfit <- cumsum(prPerf$profit)

#to compare against the default approach of investing in CD with 2% int (i.e. $6 profit out of $100 in 3 years)
prPerf$cdRet <- 6
prPerf$cumCDRet <- cumsum(prPerf$cdRet)
plot(prPerf$cumProfit)
lines(prPerf$cumCDRet, col='green')

#Or, we really do not need to have the cdRet and cumCDRet columns, since cdRet is $6 for every row

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
